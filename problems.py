# Write a Python function called sum_of_evens that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all 
# the even numbers in the list

# def sum_of_evens():  
#     sum_of_numbers=0
#     entered_numbers=input("input list of numbers sperated by a comma :")
#     numbers=entered_numbers.split(",") 
#     for number in numbers:
#         number=int(number)
#         if number%2==0:
#             sum_of_numbers=sum_of_numbers+number
#     print("sum_of_the_even_numbers_is",sum_of_numbers)
# sum_of_evens()
